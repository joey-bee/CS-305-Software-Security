Software Security


Reflection Questions
What did you do well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?

I was competent at security-in-depth strategy by ensuring to comprehensively cover various layers of security instead of using a single security solution. I effectively employed cryptographic hash-SHA-256 message integrity verification, enabled the use of the SSLE / TLS encryption to provide safe communications over HTTPS, and used the automated tool of the static analysis (OWASP Dependency-Check) to find possible vulnerabilities. Secure coding is essential as it ensures that sensitive data are not accessed, manipulated and breached by unauthorized individuals. In the particular case of Artemis Financial, software security would be of enormous value, as it would provide compliance with the regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2), safeguard the reputation of the company, customer confidence, and prevent the occurrence of expensive data breaches that might lead to legal violations and financial losses. Security is not only a technical need in the financial services industry but it is a business necessity that has a direct influence on customer confidence and competitiveness.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The tricky thing was to get it all to work with the Java Keytool and the proper configuration of the SSL/TLS certificates and the application properties of Spring Boot. One had to be attentive to detail in order to crack the code between the development self-signed certificates and the production-grade certificates. However, this challenge proved to be invaluable because it improved my understanding of the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) framework and certificates use in the creation of trusted secure communications. The OWASP Dependency-Check integration was especially useful because it offered vulnerability scanning automatically and explained to me the value of constant monitoring of the dependencies of known security flaws. This experience has illuminated the fact that security is not a single-implementation but a process that needs to be handled with care.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To enhance the security, I applied several complementary mechanisms, the first is the implementation of transport layer security, which involves changing HTTP to HTTPS with the help of the encryption of the data with the help of the use of the SSLL/TLS on port 8443 and securing the transmission of the data. Second, I implemented application-level protection in the form of SHA-256 checksums verification in order to guarantee data integrity and prevent unauthorized changes. Third, I reduced the attack surface by keeping the number of dependencies to a minimum by relying on trusted Java SE standard libraries instead of possibly dangerous third-party packages. Lastly, I put security settings in an application.properties file and then could modify it without having to res compile the code. To implement automated tools in the future, I would integrate automated tools, such as OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk, to conduct continuous vulnerability scans, source code analysis with the help of the static application security testing (SAST) tools and the running applications with the help of the dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools. I would also apply such frameworks as OWASP Top 10 and CWE/SANS Top 25 to rank mitigation methods in order of their severity and exploitability.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I was able to maintain functionality and security by use of multi stage testing method. First, I conducted functional testing to make sure that the application was running properly and that the checksum generation endpoint was created to take custom data strings and process them appropriately. I ensured secure communication whereby I used a browser to access the application using HTTPS and ensured the secure connection indicators. To verify the security, I executed the OWASP Dependency-Check plug-in, having refactored my code, to obtain a full vulnerability report, with a special emphasis on the presence of new security vulnerabilities due to my code changes. I examined the dependency report output thoroughly so that no new vulnerabilities were presented with high or critical severity rating. I also performed manual code inspection to find possible syntactical, logical and security concerns and make sure that there was correct exception management and compliance to secure coding guidelines. This was a test-refactor-test-refactor cycle that proceeded until the application was both well-functioning and secure without the addition of new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Some of the resources and practices were quite valuable: The OWASP Secure Coding Practices manual served as a good base of security-first development principles. Java Keytool to generate and manage certificates is a prerequisite to all projects that need to make some secure communications. I consider the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven plug-in a great automated vulnerability scanning tool that I will use in all my future projects involving external dependencies. The in-built support of Spring Boot for the use of the native SSL/TLS showed how security aspects of frameworks are more secure than their own implementation. I also got to know about defense-in-depth architecture, which puts a number of security layers instead of a single control. Externalizing configuration (separating security parameters and code) is an essential practice in terms of maintainability and security.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Among the major deliverables that would be presented as a result of this assignment and that would reflect my expertise in software security, I would mention the following items: The completed Practices for Secure Software Report illustrates my skills in writing security implementations in a comprehensive form and sharing technical decisions. The rewritten source code containing the SHA-256 hashing and the configuration of the SSL/TLS displays ability to work in practice in the area of safe code writing. The inclusion of the OWASP Dependency-Check in the Maven pom.xml indicates that I am familiar with the practice of a secure development lifecycle and automated security testing. This process of generating self-signed certificate demonstrates the knowledge of PKI and cryptographic infrastructure. Most significantly, this project shows that I have the capability of taking an insecure application and systematically improving it in accordance to industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and the concept of defense-in-depth. I would highlight my procedural way of handling security: I would evaluate the vulnerabilities, apply layered defenses, test and document it. This end-to-end process does not only expose the skills in coding but also in security thinking, risk evaluation and balancing security requirements with functional business requirements- all enormously sought after in professional software development positions.
